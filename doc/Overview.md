> one line description ‚Üê What issue does this module solve?

This module represents the functionality that a project may need when is looking to create an ERC20 token that has only a limited amount of tokens to be minted available.

## Features

This module has maxSupply to limit the total supply of the ERC20 token.
The maxSupply of tokens that needs to be minted will be set by the owner in the constructor of the contract during deployment.

## Use case

Generally, some ERC20 tokens have the max supply. This is effective in reducing supply and increasing token value.
